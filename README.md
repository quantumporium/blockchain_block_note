# blockchain_block_note
This is a simple implementation of a blockchain. If you whant to know more about this repositery you can check the article I made about it [here](https://penyel-djegnene.medium.com/learn-blockchain-by-creating-one-3a38cc7b263b).


## How to make it work.
To make it work you need to run the python file that is in the directory __block note__. After this step you need to go to local host 8000 on you computer you will see a html page this is one of the interface of the project.

- After that you can add transaction and mine a block.

```python
# this should make the blockchain.py file work
python blockchain.py

```

## what to improve.
- The template and interface could be improve
- Implement decentralisation in my project.
